The package is designed with the same design philosophy as the base asset: a Scriptable Object-based architecture to encourage flexibility, modularity, and testability. If you're already familiar with the base package, you'll feel right at home with its features. You can define your own damage types, designate defensive statistics used to reduce each damage type, configure the damage calculation pipeline with the desired steps, configure lifesteal for certain damage types, define strategies to execute upon entity death, and much more. Astra RPG Health Vocabulary Damage Type Damage types represent the different categories of damage that can be inflicted on entities. Common examples include \"Physical\", \"Magical\", \"Bleeding\", \"Drowning\", etc. You can create custom damage types to suit your game's needs. Damage Source Damage sources represent the origin of the damage inflicted. This is highly specific to your game's context. For example, one game might have damage sources such as \"Entity\", \"Environment\", \"Potion\", etc., while another might want to define more specific damage sources like \"Attack\", \"Spell\", \"Equipment\", \"Trap\", \"Environment\", \"Damage Over Time\", etc. The main difference between damage source and damage type is that damage types categorize damage based on its nature, while damage sources identify where the damage originates. The distinction can be subtle, but it's important for game logic and mechanics. We'll return to these concepts later, where we'll see the practical differences between the two. Heal Source Heal sources represent the origin of healing. Similar to damage sources, heal sources are specific to your game's context. Common examples include \"Potion\", \"Spell\", \"Lifesteal\", \"Ability\", \"Environment\", etc. In some games, a classic Heal Source definition might include \"Self\" and \"Ally\", as these enable mechanics for increasing healing provided/received based on the caster and target. Barrier The concept of temporary HP can take various names across different games, though the underlying mechanic remains the same: provide an amount of extra and ephemeral hit points that are deducted instead of health when damage is taken. In Astra, these temporary hit points are called \"Barrier\". Raw and Net Damage Raw Damage refers to the damage that a certain attack or skill intends to inflict. This damage does not account for resistances, critical hits, modifiers, etc. Net Damage is the result of processing Raw Damage while accounting for damage modifiers, resistances, barriers, critical hits, etc. Damage Modifiers Damage modifiers are components that can alter calculated damage in various ways. They can be used to implement mechanics such as damage reduction, damage increase, resistances, vulnerabilities, and more. Damage modifiers are generally utilized by the damage calculation pipeline (which we'll see shortly). How is Astra RPG Health organized and how does it work? Astra RPG Health Config The AstraRPGHealthConfig is a ScriptableObject that serves as the central configuration point for the Astra RPG Health package. It has several properties that allow you to define how the health and damage systems should behave in your game. With Astra RPG Framework, no configuration was needed. However, Astra RPG Health needs to be configured to work around the actual instances of the base framework's components defined for your game. For example, if you defined a certain statistic for general damage reduction in your game with Astra RPG Framework, you need to inform Astra RPG Health about it so that it can use it when calculating damage. The needed configuration is kept minimal, and convention-over-configuration is applied where possible to reduce the amount of setup required. Configuration will be deeply discussed later in Package Configuration. EntityHealth EntityHealth is a brand new MonoBehaviour that you can add to your entities to provide them with health management capabilities. Worth mentioning, it exposes the most important method of the package: TakeDamage(), which allows you to inflict damage on the entity. Damage Type DamageType is a ScriptableObject that represents a specific type of damage. Each damage type can be optionally configured with a defensive Stat that will be used to reduce incoming damage of that type. If a defensive stat is assigned, also a piercing stat can be assigned to ignore a portion of the defense when calculating damage. Both for the defensive and piercing stat, you can select a DamageReductionFormula and a DefenseReductionFormula respectively, to define how the stats will affect damage reduction and defense piercing. Damage Source DamageSource, derived from ScriptableObject, represents the origin of the damage inflicted. They don't have any specific properties, but they can be assigned to other objects of the package to create specific behaviors based on the damage source. We will see for what and how in the Workflows. Damage Reduction Functions The package comes with three built-in DamageReductionFunctions that you can use to define how defensive stats reduce incoming damage: FlatDamageReductionFn: Reduces damage by a flat amount based on the defense stat value. PercentageDamageReductionFn: Reduces damage by a percentage based on the defense stat value. LogarithmicDamageReductionFn: Reduces damage using a logarithmic scale based on the defense stat value. In case of need, custom damage reduction functions can be created by extending the DamageReductionFn class. Defense Piercing Functions As for damage reduction functions, the package comes with three built-in DefensePiercingFunctions that you can use to define how piercing stats ignore a portion of the defense stat: FlatDefensePiercingFn: Ignores a flat amount of the defense stat based on the piercing stat value. PercentageDefensePiercingFn: Ignores a percentage of the defense stat based on the piercing stat value. LogarithmicDefensePiercingFn: Ignores a portion of the defense stat using a logarithmic scale based on the piercing stat value. Also in this case, custom defense piercing functions can be created by extending the DefensePiercingFn class. Heal Source HealSource, derived from ScriptableObject, represents the origin of healing. Similar to DamageSource, they don't have any specific properties, but they can be assigned to other objects of the package to create specific behaviors based on the heal source. We will see for what and how in the Workflows. Damage Calculation Strategy The damage calculation pipeline is the component of the framework responsible for processing raw damage and producing net damage. The pipeline will use a given DamageCalculationStrategy to determine the sequence of steps to apply when calculating damage. Therefore, a DamageCalculationStrategy is a ScriptableObject that defines a sequence of DamageSteps to be executed in order when calculating damage. On-death & on-resurrection GameActions Astra RPG Framework v1.4.0 introduced the concept of GameAction: a modular and reusable unit of game logic that can be assigned via the inspector to various components to define custom behaviors. Astra RPG Health leverages Game Actions to define custom behaviors when an entity dies or is resurrected. The framework allows you to assign a default on-death Game Action that will be executed when any entity dies, unless the entity has its own custom on-death Game Action assigned. Similarly, a default on-resurrection Game Action can be assigned to be executed when an entity is resurrected. Lifesteal Configuration LifestealConfig, deriving from ScriptableObject, allows you to define how lifesteal mechanics work for specific damage types. This allows to bind a statistic to each damage type you want to have lifesteal for. That statistic will be used to calculate the amount of health to restore to the attacker when they deal damage of that type. The configuration allows also to configure the damage pipeline timing of the lifesteal effect. For example, you might want lifesteal to occur before or after damage reduction is applied. We will see this in detail later in the Workflows. Health Scaling Component Astra RPG Health provides a brand new HealthScalingComponent that you can use in your ScalingFormulas to have skills or abilities scale based on either the attacker or the target's health. You can choose to scale upon one or more among Maximum HP, Current HP, and Missing HP. Experience Collector An ExpCollector is a MonoBehaviour that you can add to your entities to allow them to collect experience points from entities that die and have an ExpSource component attached. The ExpCollector can be configured with different strategies ( ExpCollectionStrategy) to define under which conditions experience is collected from the dead entity. Experience Collection Strategy An ExpCollectionStrategy is a ScriptableObject that defines the logic for determining if an entity collects experience upon the death of another entity. More Game Events Astra RPG Health comes with many new Game Events that you can use to react to health&damage-related events in your game. Some of the most important ones are: PreDamageGameEvent: Triggered before damage is applied to an entity. Useful for modifying or canceling damage. Use this for implementing custom passives or effects that need to react before damage is taken. DamageResolutionGameEvent: Triggered when an entity takes damage. Can be used to react to damage being applied. EntityDiedGameEvent: Triggered when an entity dies. EntityHealedGameEvent: Triggered when an entity is healed. EntityResurrectedGameEvent: Triggered when an entity is resurrected. And many more events. We will discuss them in detail later in the Workflows."

    "title": "EntityHealth Component | Astra RPG Health",
    "keywords": "EntityHealth Component With Astra RPG Health, the new EntityHealth MonoBehaviour allows you to add health points to an entity. In this way, the entity can take damage and, consequently, die. Here is an example of the EntityHealth component: The events section is collapsed by default since there are many events, and it is more practical to expand it only when necessary. Let's proceed in order and analyze every property of the EntityHealth component. Health Use Class Max HP: Boolean indicating whether to use the max health points defined in the entity's class as the base max health. If disabled, you can manually specify the base max health for the entity. Base Max HP: LongRef representing the base max health of the entity. If \"Use Class Max HP\" is enabled, this value is marked with teal RO (Read Only). Read Only, for LongRef fields, makes const values non-editable, and suggests not manually modifying values contained by the associated LongVar variable, if a const value is not used. Total Max HP: LongRef representing the total max health of the entity, calculated based on the base max health and any modifiers. This field is always read-only (RO) and is automatically updated when base max health or modifiers change. Current HP: LongRef representing the entity's current health points. Editable field that is automatically updated when the entity takes damage or is healed. This field is also updated if Base Max HP is modified from the inspector. Note If Current HP drops to 0, modifying Base Max HP will not update Current HP. This is intended behavior, as if an entity is dead, it makes no sense for its health points to be modified by a change in max health. If instead the entity is alive, modifying Base Max HP will update Current HP accordingly even if Current HP is currently 0. This can happen if, for example, you change from 10 base max HP to 25 by deleting the text box with backspace: 10 (backspace) -> 1 (backspace) -> 0 (2 pressed) -> 2 (5 pressed) -> 25. Note that by deleting all numbers and leaving the box empty, Base Max HP becomes 0, and consequently Current HP also becomes 0. At this point, the entity is considered dead. Barrier: LongRef representing any barrier points (or temporary HP) of the entity. The barrier absorbs damage before it affects the entity's health points. Passive Health Regeneration: Boolean that decrees whether the entity passively regenerates HP over time or not. The regeneration frequency, as well as the statistic to consider for the amount of passively regenerated HP, are defined in the Astra RPG Health Config configuration. Restore HP On Level Up: Boolean indicating whether the entity is fully healed when leveling up. Damage For a better understanding of the first two properties of this section, I recommend taking a look at the Damage Calculation Strategy documentation. Simply put, a Damage Calculation Strategy defines how the damage an entity is about to take is calculated (e.g., applying damage reduction for the defensive stat first, or damage absorption by the barrier first, when to apply the critical multiplier, etc.). Also recall that a default strategy can be assigned via configuration. See Default Damage Calculation Strategy. Custom Damage Calculation Strategy: Field of type DamageCalculationStrategy. If the entity should use a custom damage calculation strategy, you can specify it here. This, if defined, takes precedence over the default one defined via configuration. A common use case could be, for example, a boss that cannot take more than 10% of its max health in damage at a time. Override Damage Calculation Strategy: Field of type DamageCalculationStrategy. If defined, it takes precedence over all other damage calculation strategies. Designed to be assigned at runtime to implement special effects or for testing/debug. For example, an entity is affected by a debuff that turns all physical damage into guaranteed critical hits. This debuff could therefore be implemented through a custom strategy assigned to the entity in this field. Is Immune: Boolean indicating whether the entity is immune to all damage or not. If enabled, the entity will take no damage, regardless of the damage calculation strategy used. The most important method of the package: TakeDamage The API method you will use most with this package is certainly TakeDamage, whose responsibility is to apply damage to the entity, taking into account modifiers, immunity, the damage calculation strategy, and other relevant mechanics. This method takes a PreDamageContext as input, which contains all relevant information about the damage you intend to inflict. For more details on this context, I recommend reading the documentation PreDamageContext and DamageResolutionContext. The recommended way via code to inflict damage on an entity is as follows: Construct an instance of PreDamageContext with all relevant information about the damage you intend to inflict through its fluent builder. Call TakeDamage passing the newly constructed context. Suppose we are implementing a skill that deals 50 fire damage to the target. The code to apply damage to the target could be the following: // Assuming that: // - dmgType is a DamageType representing fire damage // - dmgSource is a DamageSource representing the damage coming from a skill // - target is the EntityCore that we want to damage // - skillCaster is the EntityCore that casts the skill // first we ensure that the target has an EntityHealth component if (target.TryGetComponent(out EntityHealth targetHealth)) { // then we build the PreDamageContext with all the relevant information var preDamageContext = PreDamageContext.Builder .WithAmount(50) .WithType(dmgType) .WithSource(dmgSource) .WithTarget(target) .WithDealer(skillCaster) .Build(); // finally, we call TakeDamage to apply the damage to the target targetHealth.TakeDamage(preDamageContext); } Thanks to the PreDamageContext fluent builder, the IDE will automatically suggest the fields to fill in one at a time. As long as it presents them one at a time, it means they are required fields. If instead it presents more than one at a time, it means those fields are optional, and you can decide whether to fill them in or build the context without them. Optional fields are, for example, the critical hit flag and the critical multiplier. In the example, for simplicity, I did not fill in these fields. Now, we know that hardcoding the damage value directly in the code is not a good practice. Let's see how to use a ScalingFormula to dynamically calculate the amount of damage to inflict. The step builder creation would become the following: // Assuming that scalingFormula is a ScalingFormula that calculates the damage amount based on the skill caster's stats... // ...we calculate the damage amount by evaluating the scaling formula long damageAmount = scalingFormula.CalculateValue(skillCaster); var preDamageContext = PreDamageContext.Builder .WithAmount(damageAmount) .WithType(dmgType) .WithSource(dmgSource) .WithTarget(target) .WithDealer(skillCaster) .Build(); Healing An entity can be healed in 4 different ways: Direct healing through the Heal method. Health regeneration. This can be passive, as defined in the Health Regeneration configuration, so automatically triggered by the framework every so often, or it can be manually activated via the ManualHealthRegenerationTick method. Also for the latter, you must configure the statistic to consider for the calculation of healing through the configuration. Through lifesteal. See Lifesteal for more details on this mechanic. Via resurrection with the two Resurrect methods. One to resurrect the entity with a percentage of HP, and one to resurrect it with a fixed amount of health points. Applicable only if the entity is dead. Both regeneration (both passive and manual), lifesteal, and resurrection use, behind the scenes, the Heal method to effectively heal the entity. Since the Heal method will be widely used, I show here an example of its use via API. Suppose we want to heal an entity for 20% of its total max HP. The code could be the following: // Assuming that: // - healSource is a HealSource representing the healing coming from a skill // - skillCaster is the EntityCore that casts the healing skill // - target is the EntityCore that we want to heal if (target.TryGetComponent(out EntityHealth targetHealth)) { // in case the target has a EntityHealth component... long healAmount = target.GetMaxHpPortion(0.2d); target.Heal(PreHealContext.Builder .WithAmount(healAmount) .WithSource(healSource) .WithHealer(skillCaster) .WithTarget(target.EntityCore) .Build()); } Obviously, also in this case, it would be good practice to at least serialize the healing value in a serialized field so as to be able to modify it from the inspector, instead of having it hardcoded in the code. For simplicity, however, I did not add this step in the example. Here too, as for PreDamageContext, thanks to the PreHealContext fluent builder, the IDE will automatically suggest the fields to fill in one at a time, leaving the optional ones for last. Death Health Can Be Negative: Boolean indicating whether the entity's health points can drop below 0 before dying. If disabled, the entity's health points will never drop below 0, and the entity will die as soon as its health points reach 0. If enabled, the entity's health points can drop below 0, and the entity will die only when its health points reach a specified negative value (Death Threshold). Death Threshold: LongRef representing the entity's death threshold. Visible only if \"Health Can Be Negative\" is enabled. If the entity's health points reach this threshold, the entity dies. Override On Death Game Action: Game Action that is automatically executed when the entity dies. If defined, this takes precedence over the one defined in the configuration. Useful for implementing special behaviors upon an entity's death (for example, entities that explode upon death dealing area damage). Override On Resurrection Game Action: Game Action that is automatically executed when the entity is resurrected. If defined, this takes precedence over the one defined in the configuration. Useful for implementing special behaviors upon an entity's resurrection. Damage vs RemoveHealth and Heal vs AddHealth EntityHealth provides a couple of public methods to increase current HP and two to decrease them: Heal and AddHealth to increase current HP. TakeDamage and RemoveHealth to decrease current HP. It is important to clarify why two different methods exist to increase and decrease current HP, and when to use one or the other. AddHealth and RemoveHealth operate at a lower level of abstraction than Heal and Damage, as they directly modify the entity's current HP by a specified long value, without passing through the damage calculation pipeline or without taking into account any healing or damage modifiers. They are very predictable and direct methods, and are mainly used internally by the framework. These methods can be useful in specific situations where the gain of HP is not due to healing, or the loss of HP is not due to damage, but rather to particular mechanics that require a direct modification of current HP. For example, suppose that following a cutscene we want to force the player's HP to 1. In this case, we could use RemoveHealth to remove all HP except 1, without having to worry about any damage modifiers or the damage calculation strategy that would alter the damage taken based on the player's stats and equipment, as well as raising damage events that could trigger game logic we don't want to activate in this specific case. Heal and TakeDamage, on the other hand, are more complex methods that take into account various factors such as the damage calculation strategy, damage immunity, healing modifiers, etc. These methods are intended to be used primarily by game developers to apply damage and healing to entities, as they guarantee that all mechanics and rules of the health system are respected. For example, if you want to inflict damage on an entity, it is advisable to use the TakeDamage method, so that the damage is calculated correctly based on the configured damage calculation strategy, and that any immunities or modifiers are taken into consideration. Unsurprisingly, Heal and TakeDamage internally use AddHealth and RemoveHealth to effectively modify the entity's current HP after calculating the net HP gain or loss to apply. In 99% of cases, you will use Heal and TakeDamage to apply healing and damage to entities. AddHealth and RemoveHealth are available to cover rarer and more particular use cases. Events Events are, by default, collapsed as there are many of them and they would expand excessively in the inspector. By opening them, we should see something like this: In the image, you see already assigned events, but when you first add the component, all events will be unassigned and empty. Let's start by introducing the difference between Global Events and Extra Events. Global Events Global Events are fundamental events that transmit important information to the whole framework. Events assigned to these slots must have a global scope, i.e., they must be able to be listened to by any entity or system in the game. These events are used by the framework to handle essential features, such as lifesteal and other mechanics that require centralized communication between the various parts of the system. Warning Reserving these slots for events of a global nature is fundamental to ensure the correct functioning of the framework. Assigning Game Event instances that are specific to one or a few entities would involve operating problems at the framework level. Extra Events Extra Events, instead, are designed to transmit information to specific components or a restricted circle of entities. A practical example is the communication between the player's EntityHealth and the HUD displaying their HP: only the player possesses a dedicated HUD, so it is useful to assign an exclusive event for this interaction. In this way, the GameEvent associated with the player's EntityHealth is listened to only by the HUD, guaranteeing clear compartmentation and greater efficiency. Thus, the HUD does not receive events from all entities, but only those relevant to the player. Events Breakdown Here is a detailed description of each event. Each type of event has both the global event and a list of extra events, but it is sufficient to describe each event once. Damage Related Events To better understand the first two events of this section, I recommend taking a look at the Damage documentation to get a better understanding of damage in Astra RPG Health. Pre Damage Info Event: Event raised before the entity takes damage, and before the damage calculation pipeline calculates the net damage. This event transmits information about the damage the entity is about to take, such as the damage type, the damage source (an entity, null if not applicable), the damage source type (e.g., environmental, skill, trap, etc.), the raw damage you intend to inflict, and other relevant information. For more details regarding the context parameter and its fields, refer to the API documentation PreDamageContext. This event can be useful for implementing passive abilities or, in general, advanced mechanics that trigger effects in response to specific conditions related to the damage an entity is about to take. For example, a debuff or status modifier that amplifies critical damage taken by 50% when the damage type is \"Fire\", or a passive ability that negates all instances of damage currently being taken if they had raw damage less than 50. Damage Resolution Event: Event raised after the entity has taken or ignored damage. Similarly to the context parameter of the previous event, this event transmits detailed information about the damage just taken or ignored. For more details regarding the context parameter and its fields, refer to the API documentation DamageResolutionContext. In general, the thumb rule for deciding whether to use the Pre Damage Info Event or the Damage Resolution Event is the following: if you want to manipulate the damage an entity is about to take, it is better to subscribe to Pre Damage Info Event, and modify the context as desired; if instead you want to react to the damage an entity has just taken, and trigger effects in response to it, it is better to subscribe to Damage Resolution Event, and react based on the information transmitted by its context. Health Related Events Gained Health Event: Event raised when the entity gains HP, whether through healing or other mechanisms (e.g., Max HP modifiers that caused a gain of health). Refer to the EntityHealthChangedContext API for more details on the context parameter. Lost Health Event: Event raised when the entity loses HP, whether through taking damage or other mechanisms (e.g., Max HP modifiers that caused a loss of health). The context parameter of this event is the same as the previous one, so refer to the EntityHealthChangedContext API for more details. Max Health Changed Event: Event raised when an entity's total max health points change. This event is raised both when total max hp increase and when they decrease. See EntityMaxHealthChangedContext API for more details on the context parameter. Entity Died Event: Event raised when the entity dies. See EntityDiedContext API for more details on the context parameter. Healing Related Events Pre Heal Event: Event raised before the entity is healed. This event transmits information about the healing the entity is about to receive, such as the amount of HP you intend to heal, the entity that provided the healing (null if not applicable), the heal source (e.g., skill, item, potion, etc.) and other relevant information. For more details regarding the context parameter and its fields, refer to the API documentation PreHealContext. The amount of health points intended to heal, transmitted by this event, is the value before applying any healing modifiers. This event can be useful for implementing passive abilities or, in general, advanced mechanics that trigger effects in response to specific conditions related to the healing an entity is about to receive. For example, a buff that amplifies healing derived from potions (heal source) by 30%. Entity Healed Event: Event raised when the entity has been healed. This event transmits information about the healing just received, such as the amount of HP the entity actually gained after the application of any healing modifiers. For more on the context parameter see the ReceivedHealContext API. Here too, as for damage events, the thumb rule for deciding whether to use the Pre Heal Event or the Entity Healed Event is the following: if you want to manipulate the healing an entity is about to receive, it is better to subscribe to Pre Heal Event, and modify the context as desired; if instead you want to react to the healing an entity has just received, and trigger effects in response to it, it is better to subscribe to Entity Healed Event, and react based on the information transmitted by its context. Resurrection Related Events Entity Resurrected Event: Event raised when the entity is resurrected. See ResurrectionContext API for more details on the context parameter."

    "title": "Package Configuration | Astra RPG Health",
    "keywords": "Package Configuration Astra RPG Framework needed no configuration. The health package, however, needs to be configured to have the system work around the specific instances of your game. For example, if you defined a \"Super Duper All-damage resistance\" Stat in your game, you need to tell Astra RPG Health to use it when calculating damage. The package uses a flexible configuration system that balances convenience with explicit control. This page explains how to set up and configure the health system for your game. Configuration Overview The Astra RPG Health system uses a two-tier configuration architecture: Global Settings (AstraRpgHealthGlobalSettings) - A lightweight pointer stored in Resources that references your active configuration Gameplay Configuration (AstraRpgHealthConfig) - The actual configuration containing all gameplay parameters This separation allows you to: Switch between different configuration profiles easily (e.g., for testing, different game modes) Keep configuration data separate from the loading mechanism Support convention-based fallbacks for quick prototyping Global Settings Automatic Setup The package automatically creates the Global Settings asset on first import or when the editor loads. You don't need to do anything manually. What happens automatically: The AstraRpgHealthGlobalSettings.asset is created in Assets/Resources/ If a default configuration exists (e.g., from imported samples), it's automatically assigned The system is immediately ready to use \uD83D\uDCC1 Default Location: Assets/Resources/AstraRpgHealthGlobalSettings.asset Project Settings You can manage the health system configuration through Unity's Project Settings window: Open Edit → Project Settings Navigate to Astra RPG Health Assign your desired Active Config Profile Status Indicators: ✅ Gray \"Using Explicit Configuration\" - A configuration is explicitly assigned ⚠️ Yellow \"Using Fallback\" - No explicit configuration; using convention-based fallback \uD83D\uDED1 Red \"No Configuration Found\" - Critical: No configuration available Quick Actions: Create New Config Asset - Opens a save dialog to create a new configuration Convention Over Configuration The package follows a convention-over-configuration philosophy to reduce setup friction: Fallback Resolution If no explicit configuration is assigned in Project Settings, the system automatically searches for a configuration named: Astra Rpg Health Config located in any Resources folder in your project. Search Order The configuration provider uses a three-step loading strategy: Explicit Configuration (Project Settings) Loads AstraRpgHealthGlobalSettings from Resources/AstraRpgHealthGlobalSettings If it has an ActiveConfig assigned, use it Convention-Based Fallback Searches for Astra Rpg Health Config in any Resources folder Logs a warning indicating fallback usage Error State If neither is found, logs an error with instructions System will not function until a configuration is provided \uD83D\uDCA1 Tip: For production projects, always use explicit configuration via Project Settings for clarity and control. Configuration Loading Strategy The health configuration is loaded lazily on first access and cached for performance: // Automatically loads configuration on first access var config = AstraRpgHealthConfigProvider.Instance; // Pre-load during initialization to avoid runtime overhead AstraRpgHealthConfigProvider.WarmUp(); // Force reload (useful for testing) AstraRpgHealthConfigProvider.Reset(); When is the configuration loaded? Automatically before the first scene loads (via RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod) Lazily when first accessed via AstraRpgHealthConfigProvider.Instance Explicitly when calling WarmUp() Creating Configuration Assets If for any reason you need to create a new AstraRpgHealthConfig asset, you can do so via two methods: Via Project Settings Open Edit → Project Settings → Astra RPG Health Unassign any existing configuration, if any Click Create New Config Asset Choose a save location The new configuration is automatically assigned Via Asset Menu Right-click in the Project Window Select Create → Astra RPG Health → Configuration Name your configuration Assign it in Project Settings or in the Global Settings asset Health Configuration Reference [!INFO] In the AstraRpgHealthConfig asset, you can hover over each field to see a tooltip with a brief description. The AstraRpgHealthConfig asset contains all gameplay parameters for the health system. Below is a detailed explanation of each field. Health Health Attributes Scaling Type: AttributesScalingComponent Required: No Description: Defines how entities' maximum health scales based on character attributes (e.g., Vitality, Endurance). See Also: Astra RPG Framework Scaling documentation Generic Heal Amount Modifier Stat Type: Stat Required: No Description: The stat that modifies all healing received by an entity. Stacking Behavior: Combines additively with Source modifications How it works: The stat value represents a percentage modifier Positive values increase healing, negative values decrease it Example: A value of 25 means +25% healing received Example: Base Heal: 100 HP Generic Heal Amount Modifier: 25 (means +25%) Final Heal: 100 * 1.25 = 125 HP Heal Source Modifications Type: Dictionary<HealSource, Stat> Required: No Description: Maps each healing source (e.g., Skill, Trap, Environment) to a modifier stat. Use cases: Create specialized healing boosts or reductions (e.g., \"Resurrection healing is 50% more effective\", \"Healing from potions is reduced by 20%\") Stacking Behavior: Stats stack additively with Generic modifications Example: Incoming Heal: 100 from resurrection Generic Heal Amount Modifier: +30% (means +30% healing received) Resurrection Heal Amount Modifier: +20 (means +20% healing received) Total Heal Modification: +30% +20% = +50% → Final Heal: 150 Damage Default Damage Calculation Strategy Type: DamageCalculationStrategy Required: No Description: The default strategy used to calculate net damage when an entity doesn't specify its own strategy. Purpose: Provides a default damage calculation strategy to use for \"regular\" entities. In most cases, this is sufficient Can be overridden per-entity for custom damage pipelines in their EntityHealth component See Also: Damage Calculation Pipeline documentation Generic Damage Modification Stat Type: Stat Required: No Description: A universal damage modifier that applies to all damage received, regardless of type or source. Usage: Applied in the damage calculation pipeline if ApplyDmgModifiersStep is included in the used strategy Stacking Behavior: Combines additively with Type and Source modifications Example: Incoming Damage: 100 Generic Damage Modification: -20 (means -20% damage taken) Damage Reduction: -20% → Final Damage: 80 Damage Type Modifications Type: Dictionary<DamageType, Stat> Required: No Description: Maps each damage type (e.g., Fire, Ice, Physical) to a modifier stat. Usage: Applied in the damage calculation pipeline if ApplyDmgModifiersStep is included in the used strategy Use cases: Configure different resistances/vulnerabilities per damage type Stacking Behavior: Stats stack additively with Generic and Source modifications Example: Incoming Damage: 100 Fire damage Generic Damage Modification: +10 (means +10% damage taken) Fire Damage Modification: -30 (means -30% damage taken) Total Damage Modification: +10% - 20% = -10% → Final Damage: 90 Damage Source Modifications Type: Dictionary<DamageSource, Stat> Required: No Description: Maps each damage source (e.g., Skill, Trap, Environment) to a modifier stat. Usage: Applied in the damage calculation pipeline if ApplyDmgModifiersStep is included in the used strategy Use cases: Create specialized defenses (e.g., \"Traps deal 50% less damage\") For keeping track of damage origins for a combat log or analytics Stacking Behavior: Stats stack additively with Generic and Type modifications Example: Incoming Damage: 100 Physical damage from a Trap Generic Damage Modification: +30% (means +30% damage taken) Physical Damage Modification: -10 (means -10% damage taken) Trap Damage Modification: -50 (means -50% damage taken) Total Damage Modification: +30% -10% -50% = -30% → Final Damage: 70 Health Regeneration Health Regeneration Source Type: HealSource Required: No Description: The heal source used for passive regeneration effects. Use cases: Allows tracking and modifying regeneration separately from active healing Can be used for effects like \"Increase Regeneration by 50%\" Tracking passive healing in analytics or combat logs Passive Health Regeneration Stat (HP/10s) Type: Stat Required: No Description: Determines the amount of health regenerated passively. Warning The stat value represents health regenerated per 10 seconds. Calculation: Health Per Tick = (Stat Value / 10) * Interval In Seconds Example: Stat Value: 50 HP/10s Interval: 1 second Health Per Tick: (50 / 10) * 1 = 5 HP per second Passive Health Regeneration Interval Type: float Default: 1.0 seconds Required: Yes (must be > 0) Description: The time (in seconds) between passive regeneration ticks. Configuration Examples: Interval Stat Value Result 1.0s 50 HP/10s 5 HP every 1 second 0.5s 50 HP/10s 2.5 HP every 0.5 seconds 2.0s 50 HP/10s 10 HP every 2 seconds Warning Smaller intervals increase CPU overhead. Recommended range: 0.5s - 2.0s. Suppress Passive Regeneration Events Type: bool Required: No Description: If enabled, prevents triggering any heal events during passive regeneration ticks. Keep it disabled if you need to track passive regeneration in a combat log or if you have effects that trigger on heal events and should also apply to passive regeneration. If your game doesn't require any of the above and you want to minimize overhead, you can enable this option and skip all heal-related logic during regeneration ticks. Useful if your game has a lot of entities with passive regeneration and you want to optimize performance. If you need both to keep sending regeneration events and to minimize overhead, I advise to increase the regeneration interval and to keep the \"Suppress Passive Regeneration Events\" option disabled. This way you can have less regeneration ticks and still trigger events for each tick. Manual Health Regeneration Stat Type: Stat Required: No Description: Determines health regenerated when triggering manual regeneration via API. Use Cases: Turn-based systems: Regenerate health at the end of each turn Rest mechanics: Trigger regeneration when resting at campfires Time-skip systems: Apply regeneration for elapsed time API Usage: // Trigger manual regeneration entityHealth.ManualHealthRegenerationTick(); Lifesteal Lifesteal Config Type: LifestealConfig Required: No Description: Configuration for lifesteal mechanics (healing based on damage dealt). Typical Settings: Lifesteal percentage stat Heal source for lifesteal effects Restrictions (e.g., only on critical hits, only physical damage) See Also: Lifesteal documentation Death Default On Death Game Action Type: GameAction Required: Yes Description: The game action executed when an entity dies (if the entity doesn't have its own on-death game action). Use a composite game action to chain multiple effects. Common on-death Game Action Ideas: Destroy GameObject - Removes the entity from the scene Ragdoll - Enables ragdoll physics Respawn - Respawns the entity after a delay Loot Drop - Spawns loot and destroys the entity Example: Death → Execute composite on-death Game Action → [Spawn Death VFX → Drop Loot → Destroy GameObject] Default On Resurrection Game Action Type: GameAction Required: No Description: The game action executed when an entity is resurrected (if the entity doesn't have its own on-resurrection game action). Use a composite game action to chain multiple effects. Common on-resurrection Game Action Ideas: Simple Resurrection - Restores health and enables the entity Resurrection VFX - Plays visual effects during resurrection Stat Penalties - Applies temporary debuffs after resurrection Default Resurrection Source Type: HealSource Required: Yes Description: The heal source used when an entity is resurrected. Use cases: Categorizes resurrection healing separately from normal healing Allows effects like \"Increase Resurrection Healing by 50%\" Used for analytics and gameplay feedback Troubleshooting ⚠️ \"No Configuration found!\" error Cause: No configuration is assigned and no fallback exists. Solution: Check Project Settings → Astra RPG Health Assign a configuration or create a new one Alternatively, create a config named Astra Rpg Health Config in a Resources folder ⚠️ \"Using Fallback\" warning Cause: No explicit configuration assigned in Project Settings. Solution: Open Project Settings → Astra RPG Health Assign the fallback configuration explicitly This warning is just informational and won't break functionality ⚠️ Configuration not updating in Play Mode Cause: Configuration is cached on first access. Solution: // Force reload AstraRpgHealthConfigProvider.Reset(); ⚠️ Missing Resources folder Cause: The Assets/Resources/ folder doesn't exist. Solution: The package creates it automatically. If it's missing, create it manually: Right-click Assets Create → Folder → Name it Resources Restart Unity to trigger the bootstrapper"

Pairs well with EnableOnResurrectionStrategy to re-enable the GameObject on resurrection. Provided as a ScriptableObject for easy assignment in the editor. Create instances via Assets -> Create -> Astra RPG Health / Death strategies / Disable. DoNothingOnDeathStrategy A no-op death strategy. Use this when no action is required upon an entity's death. Provided as a ScriptableObject for easy assignment in the editor. Create instances via Assets -> Create -> Astra RPG Health / Death strategies / Do Nothing. MultipleOnDeathStrategy A death strategy that executes multiple death strategies in order. This allows combining multiple death behaviors without creating new strategy classes. Provided as a ScriptableObject for easy assignment in the editor. Create instances via Assets -> Create -> Astra RPG Health / Death strategies / Multiple. OnDeathStrategy Base strategy type for handling an entity's death. Derive from this class and implement Die(EntityHealth) to define custom death behavior."

This is the primary method for dealing damage in the Astra RPG Health system. Execution Order: Death State Check: If the entity is already dead, the damage is marked as prevented with EntityDead reason and returned immediately. Dead entities cannot take damage. Pre-Damage Event: Raises the PreDamageGameEvent to notify listeners of incoming damage. This allows systems to react before any damage calculations occur. DamageInfo Creation: Converts the PreDamageContext into a DamageInfo object that will track the damage through the calculation pipeline. Immunity Check: If the entity is immune (IsImmune is true), the damage is marked as prevented with EntityImmune reason. This happens before the pipeline to short-circuit processing. Damage Calculation Pipeline: If damage is not already prevented, the configured DamageCalculationStrategy processes the damage. The pipeline can apply: Damage reduction based on defensive stats Barrier consumption (temporary HP absorption) Critical hit calculations General damage and/or damage type and damage source modifiers Custom pipeline stages defined in the strategy The pipeline can also mark damage as prevented for various reasons. Prevention Check: If the damage was prevented (either by immunity or during the pipeline): Creates a DamageResolutionContext.Prevented result with all prevention reasons Raises the DamageResolutionGameEvent Returns immediately without affecting health Health Reduction: If damage was not prevented, the final calculated damage amount is subtracted from the entity's current health via RemoveHealth(). This may trigger the LostHealthGameEvent. Damage Resolution Event: Raises the DamageResolutionGameEvent with the applied damage information. This allows systems to react to successful damage (e.g., lifesteal, on-hit effects). Death Check: If the entity's health is now at or below the death threshold: Raises the EntityDiedGameEvent with this EntityHealth and the DamageResolutionContext Executes the on-death Game Action (either the entity's override or the config default) The death strategy handles the actual death behavior (e.g., destroy, return ot the object pool, disable, ragdoll) Return: Returns a DamageResolutionContext.Applied result containing all damage information for the caller to process if needed. Strategy Selection: The method uses the first available DamageCalculationStrategy in this priority order: OverrideDamageCalculationStrategy (if set on this EntityHealth) CustomDamageCalculationStrategy (if set on this EntityHealth) DefaultDamageCalculationStrategy (from the AstraRpgHealthConfig) public DamageResolutionContext TakeDamage(PreDamageContext preDamage) Parameters preDamage PreDamageContext The pre-damage information including base amount, damage type, dealer entity, and additional context. This is used by the damage calculation pipeline to compute the final damage to apply. Returns DamageResolutionContext A DamageResolutionContext indicating whether damage was applied or prevented. If prevented, includes the reasons for prevention. If applied, includes the final damage amounts and calculation details."

Entities can take damage, heal, die, and resurrect. Set maximum health, track current health, and configure death thresholds. Everything integrates with the core framework's stats and attributes. \uD83D\uDDE1️ Damage Types Damage types represent categories of damage in your game—Physical, Magic, Fire, Poison, etc. Define your own types as ScriptableObjects. Optionally link each damage type to a defensive statistic. For example, \"Physical Damage\" reduced by \"Armor\", or \"Magic Damage\" reduced by \"Magic Resistance\". True damage can be implemented as a damage type with no associated defensive stat. Assign piercing statistics to ignore portions of defense. \"Armor Pierce\" could reduce the effectiveness of \"Armor\" when calculating net damage. \uD83D\uDEE1️ Damage Reduction Functions Model how defensive stats reduce incoming damage using mathematical functions. The package includes three common functions: Flat reduction: Each point of defense reduces damage by a fixed amount. Predictable and easy to balance. Percentage reduction: Defense directly expresses damage reduction percentage. Effective across varying damage ranges. Logarithmic reduction: Diminishing returns as defense increases. Prevents complete damage negation. Implement custom reduction functions if the defaults don't fit your needs. \uD83D\uDEE1️ Defense Reduction Functions Piercing stats use reduction functions too, determining how they bypass defense. The same flat, percentage, and logarithmic functions are available out of the box. ⚙️ Damage Calculation Pipeline The damage calculation pipeline transforms raw damage into net damage through customizable steps. Configure the order of operations to match your game's mechanics. Pre-defined steps include: Defense mitigation: Apply defensive stats and piercing calculations Damage modifiers: Apply percentage-based buffs/debuffs for weaknesses, resistances, immunities Barrier absorption: Temporary hit points absorb damage before actual HP Critical multiplier: Multiply damage for critical hits Set a default pipeline for all entities, or assign custom pipelines to specific entities. Override pipelines at runtime for temporary effects or boss mechanics. For example, add a damage limiter step to boss entities to cap incoming damage at 10% of max HP. Or implement a debuff that doubles electric damage by swapping in a custom pipeline with an extra electric damage multiplier step. This flexibility makes implementing complex damage mechanics straightforward. \uD83E\uDE79 Heal Sources Heal sources identify where healing comes from—Potion, Skill, Regeneration, Lifesteal, Ally, Self, etc. Use heal sources to implement mechanics like bonus healing from specific sources or reduced healing from enemies. \uD83E\uDDDB Lifesteal Lifesteal converts dealt damage into health for the attacker. The system is highly configurable. Link lifesteal stats to specific damage types and choose which pipeline step it applies to—raw damage, net damage, pre-mitigation, post-mitigation, before barrier, after barrier, etc. You can fine-tune lifesteal application timing to fit your game's design. \uD83D\uDC80 Death By default, when an entity's health reaches zero, it is considered dead. The package also allows setting a custom death threshold, which can be useful for implementing mechanics such as \"down but not out\" or \"last stand\" where an entity can survive until a certain negative health value before dying. When an entity dies, a Game Action can be executed, allowing for custom behavior upon death, such as triggering events, playing animations, or dropping loot. Beyond game mechanics, Game Actions can tailor the death behavior to your architecture. For example, if your game uses object pooling, you can implement a Game Action that returns the entity to the pool instead of destroying it. Alternatively, if an entity can resurrect, you could opt for the pre-defined \"Toggle Active Game Object\" Game Action, which simply disables the entity upon death, allowing for easy resurrection later on. A default on-death Game Action for all entities can be set, and custom on-death Game Actions can be assigned to specific entities as needed. The base package, Astra RPG Framework, comes with the following pre-defined Game Actions useful for reacting to death events: Toggle Active Game Object: Enables or disables the entity's game object upon death. Useful for disabling entities that can resurrect. Destroy Game Object: Destroys the entity's game object upon death. Suitable for entities that do not need to be resurrected or reused. Toggle Renderers (and colliders): Recursively enables/disables all renderers on the GameObject and its children. Useful to switch off the visuals of a dead entity awaiting possible resurrection. No-op action: Does nothing on death. Composite action: Combines multiple on-death Game Actions to be executed in sequence upon death. \uD83D\uDE07 Resurrection Resurrection is the process of bringing a dead entity back to life. An entity can be resurrected via API, providing the amount of health to restore, either as a flat value or as a percentage of its maximum health. Similarly to on-death Game Actions, on-resurrection Game Actions can be used to define custom behavior when an entity is resurrected. The same Game Actions mentioned in the previous Death section can be used in response to resurrections. You'll likely use the Toggle Active Game Action to enable a previously disabled object, and the Toggle Renderers to re-enable previously disabled visuals and (optionally) colliders. \uD83D\uDCC8 Health Scaling Component Extend scaling formulas to use health values. Scale based on maximum health, current health, or missing health. Build abilities that grow stronger as health decreases. Create healing that scales with max HP. Design berserker mechanics that reward risk. And more. ⚡ Health Game Events New game events for health-related actions: Damage taken Healing received and applied Death and resurrection And many more... Wire these events to your game logic for abilities, UI updates, sound effects, particles, etc. \uD83D\uDED2 Where to Buy Unity Asset Store: Astra RPG Health (coming soon) \uD83D\uDCEC Information & Contact Questions, feedback, or bugs?
