## Session History

### Session 5 (2026-03-09)
- Wrote `workflows/lifesteal.md` from scratch: intro, `LifestealConfigSO`, mapping config (Lifesteal Stat, Lifesteal Source, Amount Selector with Initial/Step/Final modes), Package Configuration integration, Performance Considerations (modeled after healing.md), Conditions (NOTE + IMPORTANT callouts referencing Global Events)

### Session 4 (2026-03-09)
- Marked `workflows/damage.md` as complete
- Style-conformance pass on `workflows/package-configuration.md`: fixed invalid `[!INFO]` callout → `[!NOTE]`; replaced emoji blockquotes (`📁`, `💡`) with proper `[!NOTE]`/`[!TIP]`; replaced `> **See Also:**` blockquotes with inline links; removed `**Purpose:**` and `**Usage:**` sub-headers folding content into prose; replaced `*` with `×` for multiplication in examples; stripped `⚠️` emoji from Troubleshooting headings

### Session 3 (2026-03-09)
- Evaluated `## Damage Calculation Pipeline` outline against source code; identified missing `ApplyCriticalMultiplierStep`
- Restructured outline: replaced `### PreDamageContext and DamageResolutionContext` with `### Pipeline Data Types`; added `#### ApplyCriticalMultiplierStep`
- Wrote complete `## Damage Calculation Pipeline` section: intro, Pipeline Data Types (all 6 types + DamagePreventionReason table), Damage Step abstract base, all five `####` step subsections, Damage Calculation Strategy (two images + three-tier priority)
- Updated `_ai-context/style-guide.md`: added forward-reference anchor guidance to Cross-References section

### Session 2 (2026-03-09)
- Wrote `### True Damage Options` section (Ignore Barrier, Ignore Generic % Modifiers, Ignore Generic Flat Modifiers; IMPORTANT callout clarifying generic-only scope)


- Initial familiarization of Framework + Health packages
- Added `#### Defense Penetration` section
- Added `[!NOTE]` and `[!WARNING]` to `### Damage Reduction`
- Added formula + Log Damage Reduction Graph Window explanation to `#### Log Dmg Reduction`

- Added brief callout to `### Damage Modifiers` under Damage Types
- Created this `_ai-context/` archive

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. Review `workflows/entity-health.md`, `workflows/healing.md`, and remaining workflow files — status unknown, need assessment.
2. Review `## Dealing Damage to an Entity` for any cross-reference anchors that should link into the newly written pipeline section.
